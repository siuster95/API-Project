    <p id="intro">Welcome to my MadLib App. As a kid, these things were everywhere, and now I want to bring in my own implementation onto the colored screen.
     <br><br><b>To make a MadLib</b>, click the Make a Madlib button, select a topic, and put in some words in the form that will pop up. If the word you put into the form disappers after you click the button, that means the word was entered. Once you named all the words, you will prompted for a name before you can save the Madlib. If you leave that blank, it will give back an error saying it doesn't have a name 
     <br><br><b>To see all madlibs</b>, click the get saved Madlibs button
     <br><br><b>To check the status of the Saved Madlist List</b>, click the Head Request or Check Status Button
     <br><br><b>And to get specific Madlibs</b> click the specific Madlib button and enter in a name when prompted</p>
